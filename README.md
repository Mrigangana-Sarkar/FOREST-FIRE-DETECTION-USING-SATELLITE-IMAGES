Forest Fire Detection Using Satellite Images
Project Overview
This project leverages satellite imagery to detect forest fires using machine learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By analyzing satellite images, the model can automatically classify whether a region is affected by fire, which is crucial for timely interventions and monitoring forest health.

Objective
The goal is to develop an automated system that uses satellite images to detect the presence of forest fires, helping to mitigate the risk of larger environmental damage by providing early warnings.

Technologies Used
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): A deep learning approach for image classification tasks.
TensorFlow/Keras: Popular frameworks used for implementing and training the neural network.
Flask: A lightweight web framework for deploying the trained model.
Python: The main programming language used for model development, data processing, and application creation.
Dataset
The project uses a dataset consisting of satellite images labeled as either depicting forest fires or not. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure the images are suitable for training the CNN model.

Model Description
The CNN model is trained on a large number of labeled satellite images. It learns to distinguish between areas affected by fire and those that are not. After training, the model is deployed through a web interface, allowing users to upload new satellite images for classification.

Key Features
Image Classification: The model can predict whether an uploaded satellite image shows a forest fire.
Web Interface: A user-friendly web application built with Flask for interaction with the trained model.
Real-Time Predictions: Once deployed, the model can predict on new satellite images in real time.
How It Works
The system uses satellite images as input.
The CNN processes the image and extracts features to identify patterns related to forest fires.
The output is a classification indicating whether the image depicts a forest fire.
Installation and Setup
Detailed instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the application are provided. This ensures that users can easily replicate the setup and deploy the solution in their own environments.

Future Work
Integration with real-time satellite imagery feeds.
Improvement of the model with more advanced architectures for better accuracy.
Deployment on cloud platforms for scalability and accessibility.
